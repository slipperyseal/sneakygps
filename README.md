# SneakyGPS

SneakyGPS is a simple, USB powered GPS receiver with a high visibility 7 segment
LED display.

It features UTM readout which is a common coodinate system used on paper maps.

SneakyGPS incorporates the Adafruit Ultimate GPS Breakout board and is driven by
the Atmel ATmega328P microcontroller.  The board features a USB power plug.
Operating at 4mhz, it will also operate at lower voltates such as 3.3 volts.

This program is written for zero, a tiny pre-emptive multitasking kernel for AVR microcontrollers.
